Travis CI runs some combination of commands/a script every time we push to Github
We're gonna use it so whenever somebody pushes, we're going to check for some things
- Python testcases run
- Pylint works
- Front-end test cases work (ng test)
- Front-end linting works (ng lint)
- End-to-end tests

There's a .travis.yaml file; when you add the file to the repository, Mr. DB will make the repository watched by Travis, and whenever someone makes a push to the repository the script runs
